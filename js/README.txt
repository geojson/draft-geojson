These are the example sources for the middle and back part of the draft
rfc to ease consistent formatting and syntax checking. Edits should be
performed on these files and then copied into the ../middle.mkd and
../back.mkd respectively to not loose revisions.
The extension has been changed from .js to .geojson as a) these are GeoJSON samples 
and b) to test the new github feature automatically rendering a nice display in the users browser 
for files ending in .geojson.
