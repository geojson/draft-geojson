Proposed GeoJSON WG Charter
===========================

GeoJSON is a geospatial data interchange format based on JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON). It has succeeded in streamlining geographic information system
standards and making them accessible to practitioners of modern web
development. GeoJSON today plays an important role in many spatial databases,
web APIs, and open data platforms. This working group is charged with the
following tasks:

- The improvement of clarity for the GeoJSON format specification.
- The removal or deprecation of features that have hampered interoperability.
- The addition of implementation advice to the specification.
- The addition of extension advice to the specification.

The addition of new features to the GeoJSON format specification is not within
the charter of this working group.

The working group plans one deliverable: a GeoJSON format RFC. The working
group will start from draft-butler-geojson-04. Work on the first 4 versions of
this draft has largely accomplished the tasks listed above.
