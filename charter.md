Proposed GeoJSON WG Charter
===========================

GeoJSON is a geospatial data interchange format based on JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON). It has succeeded in streamlining geographic information system
standards and making them accessible to practitioners of modern web
development. GeoJSON today plays an important role in many spatial databases,
web APIs, and open data platforms. However, shortcomings of its original
specification have hindered and will continue to hinder implementers until
addressed. This working group is charged with the following tasks:

- improving the clarity of the GeoJSON format specification.
- removing or deprecating features that have not been widely implemented or
  have hampered interoperability.
- adding implementation advice to the specification.
- adding extension advice to the specification.

The addition of new features to the GeoJSON format specification is not within
the charter of this working group.

The working group plans one deliverable: a GeoJSON format RFC. The working
group will start from draft-butler-geojson-04. Work on the first 4 versions of
this draft has largely accomplished the tasks listed above.
