# Introduction

   GeoJSON is a format for encoding data about geographic features using
   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627].  The format is concerned
   with features in the broadest sense; any thing with qualities that
   are bounded in geographical space may be a feature whether it is
   a physical structure or not.  The concepts in GeoJSON are not new;
   they are derived from pre-existing open geographic information system
   standards (for COM, SQL, and XML) and have been streamlined to better
   suit web application development using JSON.

   GeoJSON comprises the seven concrete geometry types defined in the
   OpenGIS Simple Features Implementation Specification for SQL [SFSQL]:
   0-dimensional Point and MultiPoint; 1-dimensional curve LineString
   and MultiLineString; 2-dimensional surface Polygon and MultiPolygon;
   and the heterogeneous GeometryCollection.  GeoJSON representations of
   instances of these geometry types are analogous to the well-known
   binary (WKB) and text (WKT) representations described in that same
   specification.

   GeoJSON also comprises the types Feature and FeatureCollection.
   Feature objects in GeoJSON contain a geometry object with one of the
   above geometry types and additional properties. A FeatureCollection
   object contains an array of feature objects.  This structure is
   analogous to that of the Web Feature Service (WFS) response to
   GetFeatures requests specified in [WFSv1] or to a KML Folder of
   Placemarks [KMLv2.2].  Some implementations of the WFS specification
   also provide GeoJSON formatted responses to GetFeature requests, but
   there is no particular service model or feature type ontology implied
   in the GeoJSON format specification.

   Since its initial publication in 2008 [GeoJSON], the GeoJSON
   format specification has steadily grown in popularity.  It is widely
   used in JavaScript web mapping libraries, JSON-based document
   databases, and web APIs.

## Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   [RFC2119].

## Conventions Used in This Document

The ordering of the members of any JSON object defined in this document
MUST be considered irrelevant, as specified by [RFC4627].

Some examples use the combination of a JavaScript single line comment
(//) followed by an ellipsis (...) as placeholder notation for content
deemed irrelevant by the authors. These placeholders must of course be
deleted or otherwise replaced, before attempting to validate the
corresponding JSON code example.

Whitespace is used in the examples inside this document to help
illustrate the data structures, but is not required. Unquoted whitespace
is not significant in JSON.

## Definitions

* JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and the terms object, name, value,
  array, number, true, false, and null are to be interpreted as defined
  in [RFC4627].

* Inside this document the term "geometry type" refers to the seven
  case-sensitive strings: "Point", "MultiPoint", "LineString",
  "MultiLineString", "Polygon", "MultiPolygon", and
  "GeometryCollection".

* As another shorthand notation the term GeoJSON types refers to the
  nine case-sensitve strings "Feature", "FeatureCollection" and the
  geometry types listed above.

## Example

A GeoJSON feature collection:

    {
        "type": "FeatureCollection",
        "features": [{
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [102.0, 0.5]
            },
            "properties": {
                "prop0": "value0"
            }
        }, {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "LineString",
                "coordinates": [
                    [102.0, 0.0],
                    [103.0, 1.0],
                    [104.0, 0.0],
                    [105.0, 1.0]
                ]
            },
            "properties": {
                "prop0": "value0",
                "prop1": 0.0
            }
        }, {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Polygon",
                "coordinates": [
                    [
                        [100.0, 0.0],
                        [101.0, 0.0],
                        [101.0, 1.0],
                        [100.0, 1.0],
                        [100.0, 0.0]
                    ]
                ]
            },
            "properties": {
                "prop0": "value0",
                "prop1": {
                    "this": "that"
                }
            }
        }]
    }

# GeoJSON Object

GeoJSON always consists of a single object. This object (referred to as
the GeoJSON object below) represents a geometry, feature, or collection
of features.

* The GeoJSON object MUST have a member with the name "type". The value
  of the member MUST be one of the GeoJSON types.

* The GeoJSON object MAY have any number of other members.

* A GeoJSON object MAY have a "bbox" member, the value of which MUST be
  a bounding box array (see 4. Bounding Boxes).

## Geometry Object

A geometry object is a GeoJSON object where the "type" value is one of
the geometry types. A GeoJSON geometry object of any type other than
"GeometryCollection" MUST have a member with the name "coordinates". The
value of the coordinates member is always an array. The structure of the
elements in this array is determined by the type of geometry.

### Position

A position is the fundamental geometry construct. The "coordinates"
member of a geometry object is composed of either:

* one position (in the case of a Point geometry),

* an array of positions (LineString or MultiPoint geometries),

* an array of arrays of positions (Polygons, MultiLineStrings),

* or a multidimensional array of positions (MultiPolygon).

A position is represented by an array of numbers. There MUST be two or
more elements. The first two elements will be longitude and latitude, 
or easting and northing, precisely in that order and using decimal numbers.
Altitude or elevation MAY be included as an optional third element.

Additional position elements MAY be included but MUST follow the three
specified above and MAY be ignored by software. Interpretation and
meaning of additional elements is beyond the scope of this
specification.

Examples of positions and geometries are provided in "Appendix A.
Geometry Examples".

### Point

For type "Point", the "coordinates" member MUST be a single position.

### MultiPoint

For type "MultiPoint", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of
positions.

### LineString

For type "LineString", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of two
or more positions.

### MultiLineString

For type "MultiLineString", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of
LineString coordinate arrays.

### Polygon

To specify a constraint specific to polygons, it is useful to introduce
the concept of a linear ring:

* A linear ring is a closed LineString with 4 or more positions.

* The first and last positions are equivalent (they represent
  equivalent points).

* A linear ring is the boundary of a surface or the boundary of a hole in
  a surface.

Though a linear ring is not explicitly represented as a GeoJSON geometry
type, it leads to a canonical formulation of the Polygon geometry type
definition as follows:

* For type "Polygon", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of
  linear ring coordinate arrays.

* For Polygons with more than one of these rings, the first MUST be the
  exterior ring and any others MUST be interior rings. The exterior ring
  bounds the surface and the interiors rings (if present) bound holes
  within the surface.

### MultiPolygon

For type "MultiPolygon", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of
Polygon coordinate arrays.

### Geometry Collection

A GeoJSON object with type "GeometryCollection" is a geometry object
which represents a collection of geometry objects. A geometry collection
MUST have a member with the name "geometries".  The value corresponding
to "geometries" is an array. Each element in this array is a GeoJSON
geometry object.

## Feature Object

A GeoJSON object with the type "Feature" is a feature object.

* A feature object MUST have a member with the name "geometry". The
  value of the geometry member SHALL be either a geometry object as
  defined above or, in the the case that the feature is unlocated,
  a JSON null value. 

* A feature object MUST have a member with the name "properties". The
  value of the properties member is an object (any JSON object or a
  JSON null value).

* If a feature has a commonly used identifier, that identifier SHOULD be
  included as a member of the feature object with the name "id" and the
  value of this member is either a JSON string or number.

## Feature Collection Object

A GeoJSON object with the type "FeatureCollection" is a feature
collection object. An object of type "FeatureCollection" MUST have
a member with the name "features". The value corresponding to "features"
is an array. Each element in the array is a feature object as defined
above.

# Coordinate Reference System Object

The coordinate reference system (CRS) of a GeoJSON object is determined by its
OPTIONAL "crs" member (referred to as the CRS object below). If an object has
no crs member, then its parent or grandparent object's crs member SHALL be
acquired.  If no crs member can be so acquired, the default CRS SHALL apply to
the GeoJSON object.

The default coordinate reference system for all GeoJSON objects SHALL be
a geographic coordinate reference system, using the WGS84 datum, and with
longitude and latitude units of decimal degrees. This coordinate reference
system is equivalent to the OGC's urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC::CRS84 [OGCURN]. An
OPTIONAL third position element SHALL be the height in meters above the WGS 84
reference ellipsoid. For widest interoperability, GeoJSON data SHOULD use this
default coordinate reference system and omit CRS objects.

If an application demands a different coordinate reference system, the
following specifications shall be followed:

* CRS SHOULD be defined as highly in GeoJSON object hierarchy as possible,
  ideally in the FeatureCollection, and SHOULD NOT be repeated or overridden
  in child objects.

* The value of a member named "crs" is a JSON object (referred to as the
  CRS object below) or JSON null. If the value of CRS is null, no CRS can be
  assumed.

* A non-null CRS object has two mandatory members: "type" and "properties".

* The value of the type member indicates the type of CRS object.

* The value of the properties member must be an object.

* The presence of a CRS object SHALL NOT change the ordering of coordinates
  specified in section 2.1.1.

## Named CRS

A CRS object may indicate a coordinate reference system by name. In this case,
the value of its "type" member must be the string "name". The value of its
"properties" member must be an object containing a "name" member. The value of
that "name" member must be a string identifying a coordinate reference system.
OGC CRS URNs such as "urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC::CRS84" are RECOMMENDED over
legacy identifiers such as "EPSG:4326".

    "crs": {
        "type": "name",
        "properties": {
            "name": "urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC::CRS84"
        }
    }

## Linked CRS

A CRS object may link to CRS parameters on the Web. In this case, the value of
its "type" member must be the string "link", and the value of its "properties"
member must be a Link object.

A link object has one required member: "href", and one optional member: "type".
The value of the required "href" member must be a dereferenceable URI. The
value of the optional "type" member must be a string that hints at the
format used to represent CRS parameters at the provided URI. Suggested values
are: "proj4", "ogcwkt", "esriwkt", but others can be used::

    "crs": {
        "type": "link", 
        "properties": {
            "href": "http://example.com/crs/42",
            "type": "proj4"
        }
    }
    
Relative links may be used to direct processors to CRS parameters in an
auxiliary file:

    "crs": {
        "type": "link",
        "properties": {
            "href": "data.crs",
            "type": "ogcwkt"
        }
    }

# Bounding Box

A GeoJSON object MAY have a member named "bbox" to include information
on the coordinate range for its geometries, features, or feature
collections. The value of the bbox member MUST be an array of length
2*n where n is the number of dimensions represented in the contained
geometries, with the lowest values for all axes followed by the highest
values. The axes order of a bbox follows the axes order of geometries.

Example of a bbox member on a feature:

    {
        "type": "Feature",
        "bbox": [-180.0, -90.0, 180.0, 90.0],
        "geometry": {
            "type": "Polygon",
            "coordinates": [
                [
                    [-180.0, 10.0],
                    [20.0, 90.0],
                    [180.0, -5.0],
                    [-30.0, -90.0]
                ]
            ]
        }
        //...
    }

Example of a bbox member on a feature collection:

    {
        "type": "FeatureCollection",
        "bbox": [100.0, 0.0, 105.0, 1.0],
        "features": [
        //...
        ]
    }
