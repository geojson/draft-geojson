# Introduction

   GeoJSON is a format for encoding data about geographic features using
   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC7159].  The format is concerned
   with features in the broadest sense; any thing with qualities that
   are bounded in geographical space might be a feature whether it is
   a physical structure or not.  The concepts in GeoJSON are not new;
   they are derived from pre-existing open geographic information system
   standards (for COM, SQL, and XML) and have been streamlined to better
   suit web application development using JSON.

   GeoJSON comprises the seven concrete geometry types defined in the
   OpenGIS Simple Features Implementation Specification for SQL [SFSQL]:
   0-dimensional Point and MultiPoint; 1-dimensional curve LineString
   and MultiLineString; 2-dimensional surface Polygon and MultiPolygon;
   and the heterogeneous GeometryCollection.  GeoJSON representations of
   instances of these geometry types are analogous to the well-known
   binary (WKB) and text (WKT) representations described in that same
   specification.

   GeoJSON also comprises the types Feature and FeatureCollection.
   Feature objects in GeoJSON contain a geometry object with one of the
   above geometry types and additional members. A FeatureCollection
   object contains an array of feature objects.  This structure is
   analogous to that of the Web Feature Service (WFS) response to
   GetFeatures requests specified in [WFSv1] or to a KML Folder of
   Placemarks [KMLv2.2].  Some implementations of the WFS specification
   also provide GeoJSON formatted responses to GetFeature requests, but
   there is no particular service model or feature type ontology implied
   in the GeoJSON format specification.

   Since its initial publication in 2008 [GJ2008], the GeoJSON
   format specification has steadily grown in popularity.  It is widely
   used in JavaScript web mapping libraries, JSON-based document
   databases, and web APIs.

## Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

## Conventions Used in This Document

The ordering of the members of any JSON object defined in this document
MUST be considered irrelevant, as specified by [RFC7159].

Some examples use the combination of a JavaScript single line comment
(//) followed by an ellipsis (...) as placeholder notation for content
deemed irrelevant by the authors. These placeholders must of course be
deleted or otherwise replaced, before attempting to validate the
corresponding JSON code example.

Whitespace is used in the examples inside this document to help
illustrate the data structures, but is not required. Unquoted whitespace
is not significant in JSON.

## Specification of GeoJSON

This document updates the original GeoJSON format specification
[GJ2008].

## Definitions

* JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and the terms object, member,
  name, value, array, number, true, false, and null are to be
  interpreted as defined in [RFC7159].

* Inside this document the term "geometry type" refers to the seven
  case-sensitive strings: "Point", "MultiPoint", "LineString",
  "MultiLineString", "Polygon", "MultiPolygon", and
  "GeometryCollection".

* As another shorthand notation, the term "GeoJSON types" refers to the
  nine case-sensitive strings "Feature", "FeatureCollection" and the
  geometry types listed above.

## Example

A GeoJSON feature collection:

    {
        "type": "FeatureCollection",
        "features": [{
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [102.0, 0.5]
            },
            "properties": {
                "prop0": "value0"
            }
        }, {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "LineString",
                "coordinates": [
                    [102.0, 0.0],
                    [103.0, 1.0],
                    [104.0, 0.0],
                    [105.0, 1.0]
                ]
            },
            "properties": {
                "prop0": "value0",
                "prop1": 0.0
            }
        }, {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Polygon",
                "coordinates": [
                    [
                        [100.0, 0.0],
                        [101.0, 0.0],
                        [101.0, 1.0],
                        [100.0, 1.0],
                        [100.0, 0.0]
                    ]
                ]
            },
            "properties": {
                "prop0": "value0",
                "prop1": {
                    "this": "that"
                }
            }
        }]
    }

# GeoJSON Text

A GeoJSON text is a JSON text and consists of a single GeoJSON object.

# GeoJSON Object

A GeoJSON object represents a geometry, feature, or collection of
features.

* A GeoJSON object is a JSON object.

* A GeoJSON object MUST have a member with the name "type". The value
  of the member MUST be one of the GeoJSON types.

* A GeoJSON object MAY have a "bbox" member, the value of which MUST be
  a bounding box array (see [](#bounding-box)).

* A GeoJSON object MAY have any number of other members (see
  [](#extending-geojson)).

## Geometry Object

A geometry object is a GeoJSON object where the "type" value is one of
the geometry types. Geometry objects represent points, curves, and
surfaces in coordinate space.

A GeoJSON geometry object of any type other than "GeometryCollection"
MUST have a member with the name "coordinates". The value of the
coordinates member is always an array. The structure of the elements in
this array is determined by the type of geometry. GeoJSON processors MAY
interpret geometry objects with empty coordinates arrays as null
objects.

### Position

A position is the fundamental geometry construct. The "coordinates"
member of a geometry object is composed of either:

* one position (in the case of a Point geometry),

* an array of positions (LineString or MultiPoint geometries),

* an array of arrays of positions (Polygons, MultiLineStrings),

* or a multidimensional array of positions (MultiPolygon).

A position is an array of numbers. There MUST be two or
more elements. The first two elements are longitude and latitude,
or easting and northing, precisely in that order and using decimal numbers.
Altitude or elevation MAY be included as an optional third element.

Implementations SHOULD NOT extend positions beyond 3 elements. Parsers
MAY ignore additional elements. Interpretation and meaning of additional
elements is beyond the scope of this specification.

Examples of positions and geometries are provided in "Appendix A.
Geometry Examples".

### Point

For type "Point", the "coordinates" member MUST be a single position.

### MultiPoint

For type "MultiPoint", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of
positions.

### LineString

For type "LineString", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of two
or more positions.

### MultiLineString

For type "MultiLineString", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of
LineString coordinate arrays.

### Polygon

To specify a constraint specific to polygons, it is useful to introduce
the concept of a linear ring:

* A linear ring is a closed LineString with 4 or more positions.

* The first and last positions are equivalent, they MUST contain identical
  values; their representation SHOULD also be identical.

* A linear ring is the boundary of a surface or the boundary of a hole in
  a surface.

* A linear ring SHOULD follow right-hand rule with respect to the area
  it bounds (i.e., exterior rings are counter-clockwise, holes are
  clockwise)

Though a linear ring is not explicitly represented as a GeoJSON geometry
type, it leads to a canonical formulation of the Polygon geometry type
definition as follows:

* For type "Polygon", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of
  linear ring coordinate arrays.

* For Polygons with more than one of these rings, the first MUST be the
  exterior ring and any others MUST be interior rings. The exterior ring
  bounds the surface and the interiors rings (if present) bound holes
  within the surface.

### MultiPolygon

For type "MultiPolygon", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of
Polygon coordinate arrays.

### Geometry Collection

A GeoJSON object with type "GeometryCollection" is a geometry object.
A geometry collection MUST have a member with the name "geometries". The
value of "geometries" is an array. Each element of this array is a GeoJSON
geometry object. It is possible for this array to be empty.

Unlike the other geometry types described above,
a geometry collection can be a heterogeneous composition of smaller
geometry objects. For example, a geometry object in the shape of
a lowercase roman "i" can be composed of one point and one line string.

## Feature Object

A GeoJSON object with the type "Feature" is a feature object.

* A feature object MUST have a member with the name "geometry". The
  value of the geometry member SHALL be either a geometry object as
  defined above or, in the the case that the feature is unlocated,
  a JSON null value.

* A feature object MUST have a member with the name "properties". The
  value of the properties member is an object (any JSON object or a
  JSON null value).

* If a feature has a commonly used identifier, that identifier SHOULD be
  included as a member of the feature object with the name "id" and the
  value of this member is either a JSON string or number.

## Feature Collection Object

A GeoJSON object with the type "FeatureCollection" is a feature
collection object. A feature collection object MUST have a member with
the name "features". The value of "features" is an array. Each element
of the array MUST be a feature object as defined above. It is possible
for this array to be empty. The values in the array are ordered, meaning
that GeoJSON implementations MUST maintain order when processing them.

# Coordinate Reference System

The default reference system for all GeoJSON coordinates SHALL be
a geographic coordinate reference system, using the [WGS84] datum, and
with longitude and latitude units of decimal degrees. This coordinate
reference system is equivalent to the OGC's
"http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84" [OGCURL]. To maximize
interoperability, GeoJSON data SHOULD use this default coordinate
reference system.  An OPTIONAL third position element SHALL be the
height in meters above the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid. In the absence of
elevation values, applications sensitive to height or depth SHOULD
interpret positions as being at local ground or sea level.

Other coordinate reference systems, including ones described by CRS
objects of the kind defined in [GJ2008] are NOT RECOMMENDED. GeoJSON
processing software SHALL NOT be expected to have access to coordinate
reference systems databases. Applications requiring a CRS other than the
default MUST assume all responsibility for CRS identification,
coordinate accuracy, and interpretation of missing elevation values.
Furthermore, GeoJSON coordinates MUST NOT under any circumstances use
latitude, longitude order. See Section 8, Interoperability
Considerations, for guidance in processing GeoJSON documents that do
contain such a CRS object.

# Bounding Box

A GeoJSON object MAY have a member named "bbox" to include information
on the coordinate range for its geometries, features, or feature
collections. The value of the bbox member MUST be an array of length
2*n where n is the number of dimensions represented in the contained
geometries, with all axes of the most south-westerly point followed by
all axes of the more north-easterly point. The axes order of a bbox
follows the axes order of geometries.

Example of a bbox member on a feature:

    {
        "type": "Feature",
        "bbox": [-10.0, -10.0, 10.0, 10.0],
        "geometry": {
            "type": "Polygon",
            "coordinates": [
                [
                    [-10.0, -10.0],
                    [10.0, -10.0],
                    [10.0, 10.0],
                    [-10.0, -10.0]
                ]
            ]
        }
        //...
    }

Example of a bbox member on a feature collection:

    {
        "type": "FeatureCollection",
        "bbox": [100.0, 0.0, 105.0, 1.0],
        "features": [
        //...
        ]
    }

## The Antimeridian

Consider a set of point features within the Fiji archipelago, straddling
the antimeridian between 16°S and 20°S. The southwest corner of the box
containing these features is at 20°S and 177°E, the northwest corner is
at 16°S and 178°W. In the default GeoJSON CRS (see
[](#coordinate-reference-system)) the antimeridian-spanning GeoJSON
bounding box for this feature collection is

    "bbox": [177.0, -20.0, -178.0, -16.0]

and covers 5 degrees of longitude.

The complementary bounding box for the same latitude band, not crossing
the antimeridian, is

    "bbox": [-178.0, -20.0, 177.0, -16.0]

and covers 355 degrees of longitude.

The latitude of the northeast corner is always greater than the latitude
of the southwest corner, but bounding boxes that cross the antimeridian
have a northeast corner longitude that is less than the longitude of the
southwest corner.


## The Poles

In the default GeoJSON CRS (see [](#coordinate-reference-system)),
a bounding box that contains the North Pole extends from a southwest
corner of %minlat% degrees N, 180 degrees W to a northeast corner of 90
degrees N, 180 degrees E. Viewed on a globe, this bounding box
approximates a spherical cap.

    "bbox": [-180.0, %minlat%, 180.0, 90.0]

A bounding box that contains the South Pole extends from a southwest
corner of 90 degrees S, 180 degrees W to a northeast corner of
%maxlat% degrees S, 180 degrees E.

    "bbox": [-180.0, -90.0, 180.0, %maxlat%]

A bounding box that just touches the North Pole and forms a slice of an
approximate spherical cap when viewed on a globe has as its northeast
corner coordinates the easternmost longitude value and 90 degrees N.


    "bbox": [%westlon%, %minlat%, %eastlon%, 90.0]

A bounding box that just touches the South Pole and forms a slice of an
approximate spherical cap when viewed on a globe has as its southwest
corner coordinates the westernmost longitude value and 90 degrees S.


    "bbox": [%westlon%, -90.0, %eastlon%, %maxlat%]

Implementers MUST NOT use latitude values greater than 90 or less than
-90 when using the default GeoJSON coordinate reference system to imply
an extent that is not a spherical cap.

# Extending GeoJSON

## Foreign members

Members not described in this specification ("foreign members") MAY be
used in a GeoJSON document. Note that support for foreign members can
vary across implementations and no normative processing model for
foreign members is defined. Accordingly, implementations that rely too
heavily on the use of foreign members might experience reduced
interoperability with other implementations.

For example, in the (abridged) feature object shown below

    {
        "type": "Feature",
        "id": "f1",
        "geometry": {...},
        "properties": {...},
        "title": "Example Feature",
    }

the name/value pair of "title": "Example Feature" is a foreign member.
When the value of a foreign member is an object, all the descendant
members of that object are themselves foreign members.

GeoJSON semantics do not apply to foreign members and their descendants,
regardless of their names and values. For example, in the (abridged)
feature object below

    {
        "type": "Feature",
        "id": "f2",
        "geometry": {...},
        "properties": {...},
        "centerline": {
            "type": "LineString",
            "coordinates": [
                [-170, 10],
                [170, 11]
            ]
        },
    }

the "centerline" member is not a GeoJSON geometry object.

## GeoJSON types are not extensible

Implementations MUST NOT extend the fixed set of GeoJSON types:
FeatureCollection, Feature, Point, LineString, MultiPoint, Polygon,
MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection.

## Semantics of GeoJSON members and types are not changeable

Implementations MUST NOT change the the semantics of GeoJSON members and
types.

The GeoJSON "coordinates" and "geometries" members define Geometry
objects. FeatureCollection and Feature objects, respectively, MUST NOT
contain a "coordinates" or "geometries" member.

The GeoJSON "geometry" and "properties" members define a Feature object.
FeatureCollection and Geometry objects, respectively, MUST NOT contain
a "geometry" or "properties" member.

The GeoJSON "features" member defines a FeatureCollection object.
Feature and Geometry objects, respectively, MUST NOT contain
a "features" member.

# Mapping 'geo' URIs

'geo' URIs [RFC5870] identify geographic locations and precise (not uncertain)
locations can be mapped to GeoJSON geometry objects.

For this section, as in [RFC5870], "%lat%", "%lon%", "%alt%", and "%unc%"
are placeholders for 'geo' URI latitude, longitude, altitude, and uncertainty
values, respectively.

A 'geo' URI with two coordinates and an uncertainty ('u') parameter that
is absent or zero, and a GeoJSON Point geometry may be mapped to each other.
A GeoJSON point is always converted to a 'geo' URI that has no uncertainty
parameter.

'geo' URI:

  geo:%lat%,%lon%

GeoJSON:

  {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [%lon%, %lat%]}

The mapping between 'geo' URIs and GeoJSON points that specify elevation is
shown below.

'geo' URI:

  geo:%lat%,%lon%,%alt%

GeoJSON:

  {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [%lon%, %lat%, %alt%]}

GeoJSON has no concept of uncertainty; imprecise or uncertain 'geo' URIs thus
can not be mapped to GeoJSON geometries.
